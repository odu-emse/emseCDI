# Syllabus

## Course Overview

Integrated analysis of quality assurance function. Defining quality: Deming, Juran, Taguchi, Quality cost concept and economic aspects of quality decisions, Continuous improvement, Design for quality, On-line quality engineering: Scientific sampling, Statistical process control: Control charts for variables, Control charts for attributes, Models for problem solving, Design of experiments.

## Course Administration

This course is designed to be paperless. Submission of test and assignments will normally be done electronically. Students are expected to have the capabilities (knowledge, skills, and tools) to use e-mail, an internet browser, and the Windows operating system.
