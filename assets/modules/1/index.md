Student evaluation will be expressed in raw marks (out of 100% for each evaluation component)
during the course delivery. Mark total for the course will be obtained by assigning the
component weights given above to the marks obtained in the course, and summing up the
weighed marks. The letter grade system will then be applied to the final total mark only. As a
guideline, the following grading scale will be used:

#### Grade Percentage

-   A 93.0 – 100.0
-   A- 90.0 – 92.9
-   B+ 87.0 – 89.9
-   B 83.0 – 86.9
-   B- 80.0 – 82.9
-   C+ 77.0 – 79.9

## Feedback:

Questions, comments and suggestions regarding the course will be greatly appreciated.
Electronic means of communication are preferred for discussions regarding lectures,
assignments, and exams. To foster promptness in responding, please send questions from an Old

## Class Attendance:

Class attendance is “expected”. If for some reason a student should miss a class, it is the
student’s responsibility to:

1. Inform themselves of any administrative announcements (e.g. schedule changes)
   discussed during a session.
2. “Make-up” any of the course material covered in the session. This is of particular
   importance as there will be material presented in the sessions that may not be covered
   adequately in the textbook.
   It is not necessary to inform me of an absence should a situation arise where attendance is not
   possible. Please note however, that I reserve the right not to provide extensive information about
   what transpired in a class.

## Class Conduct:

Please make every attempt to be in class on time. For the sake of your colleagues, please do not
hold private conversations in class. If the need to talk is overwhelming, please exit discretely.

## ODU Honor Code:

The Old Dominion University Honor code is in effect for all work submitted. It states:

dishonesty or deception, such as cheating or plagiarism. I am aware that as a member of the academic community,
it is my responsibility to turn in all suspected violators of the Honor System. I will report to an Honor Council
hearing if summoned."

## Course Syllabus:

made to provide a syllabus that is complete and that provides an accurate overview of the course.
