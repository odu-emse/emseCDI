## Class Attendance:

## Class attendance is “expected”. If for some reason a student should miss a class, it is the

## student’s responsibility to:

## 1. Inform themselves of any administrative announcements (e.g. schedule changes)

## discussed during a session.

## 2. “Make-up” any of the course material covered in the session. This is of particular

## importance as there will be material presented in the sessions that may not be covered

## adequately in the textbook.

## It is not necessary to inform me of an absence should a situation arise where attendance is not

## possible. Please note however, that I reserve the right not to provide extensive information about

## what transpired in a class.

## Class Conduct:

## Please make every attempt to be in class on time. For the sake of your colleagues, please do not

## hold private conversations in class. If the need to talk is overwhelming, please exit discretely.
